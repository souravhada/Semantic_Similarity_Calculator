# Semantic_Similarity_Calculator
A Flask web app using TensorFlow that calculates cosine similarity between input paragraphs. Leverages Universal Sentence Encoder for text encoding and provides text cleaning functionality.
This project is a web application built using Flask and TensorFlow that allows users to input two paragraphs and calculates the cosine similarity between them. It uses the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model to encode the paragraphs into vector representations and then applies cosine similarity to measure their similarity. The application also includes text cleaning functionality to remove HTML tags, non-alphanumeric characters, and extra whitespaces. The clean_text function and the cosine_similarity function are implemented to facilitate these tasks. The project demonstrates how to leverage NLP techniques and pre-trained models for text similarity analysis.
